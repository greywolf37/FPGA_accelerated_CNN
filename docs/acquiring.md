# Acquiring Lab 4 Code

Submitting your final project codebase requires you to sign up for the final project on GitHub Classroom then to clone from the repository created for you.

To sign up for the final project, visit this link: [https://classroom.github.com/a/VJgX3Htl](https://classroom.github.com/a/VJgX3Htl).

Visit your newly created repository then clone your repository using the HTTPS option. An example command for a user with the Github username benfranklin would have a git clone command similar to this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/penn-ese680-002/project-benfranklin.git 
```

Once cloned, follow the rest of these handouts making sure to commit your changes often. Ideally, you should commit your changes at least at the completion of each milestone.
